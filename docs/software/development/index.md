# Development

## Base Development Tools

If you are wanting to compile software under Solus, we recommend installing our system.devel component by running the following:

``` bash
sudo eopkg install -c system.devel
```

This will provide items such as clang, gcc, make, a multitude of devel sub-packages, and more. Our system.devel is similar to packages on other operating systems, such as Debian's build-essentials.
