## Default Applications

Using MATE, open the Brisk Menu and click on "Preferences" and then on "Preferred Applications".

In this section you will need to click one of the five tabs at the top to find the category you wish to change.  For most categories, you will need to have installed alternative applications before you can change the default settings.  For instance, if you wish to change the default image viewer from Eye of MATE to GIMP then you must first install GIMP (available in the Software Center).

![MATE Preferred Applications](configuration/mate-preferred-applications.jpg)

You can specify default applications for individual file types by right clicking on a file and then clicking on "Open with other Application...".

![MATE File Context Menu](configuration/mate-open-with-right-click.jpg)

Next, select the application you wish to use and make sure "Remember this application for "your file type" files" is ticked.  Finish by clicking "Open".  In the future, all files with the same file type will open with the same application.
