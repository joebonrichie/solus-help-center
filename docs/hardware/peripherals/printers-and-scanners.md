# Printers

## Drivers

Many printers will work out-of the box on Solus. If yours doesn't, you should try installing additional drivers.

| Brand | Driver Package(s)          |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| Canon | canon-ufriilt-common       |
| Dymo  | dymo-cups-driver           |
| Epson | epson-inkjet-printer-escpr |
| HP    | hplip                      |

### Brother

Brother drivers are distributed by Brother for a single printer only. Because of this, you will need to install the package for your specific printer.

For example, `brother-mfc1910w` provides drivers for the MFC-1910w.

# Scanners

## Brother

You can connect your Brother scanner via USB or LAN to be able to scan. To get newer Brother scanners to work you will have to install the package `brscan4`

### Network Scanner

If your scanner is networks, you need to tell `saned` the IP of your printer. It's advised to give your printer always the same IP inside your Network (ie. Static IP Address). Run the following command to accomplish this:

``` bash
brsaneconfig4 -a name=SCANNER model=$MODEL ip=$IPOFYOURSCANNER
```
